# Business Operations Readiness

This document turns the demo/repository into an operating business checklist without performing irreversible actions. It was generated on 2026-06-26 from the portfolio audit and current public docs. It is operational planning, not legal, tax, or financial advice.

## Commercial position

- Priority: **P2-supporting-asset**
- Monetization path: **B2B lead-gen / consulting demo**
- Secondary path: **public demo/readme polish candidate**
- Readiness score: **60/100**
- Visibility: **public**
- Archived: **false**

## Deployment lane: static-preview-first

- Use a preview deployment first; Cloudflare Pages or GitHub Pages are the lowest-friction static lanes.
- Before custom domain/DNS, verify no secrets, no customer data, and no unsupported revenue claims are published.
- Prefer screenshots or a gated preview link for sales until privacy/support/payment pages are approved.

## Payment lane: paid-discovery-after-scope

- Do not add self-serve checkout before scope is clear; use discovery call + written proposal.
- Optional later: hosted Stripe Payment Link for a fixed paid-discovery deposit after KYC/tax/refund terms are approved.
- Never commit Stripe secret keys; use hosted links or server-side env vars only.

## Privacy and data lane: privacy-standard-minimize-data

- Review 2 redacted secret-pattern finding(s) from the audit index before publishing or deploying.
- Inventory personal data, customer data, logs, analytics identifiers, uploaded files, and model prompts before launch.
- Collect the minimum data needed; define retention, deletion, access control, incident response, and data export/deletion request handling.
- Publish a plain-language privacy policy before collecting contact, analytics, payment, or uploaded-file data; this draft is not legal advice.

## Customer support lane: pilot-support-sla

- Create one support inbox/alias and a private customer tracker before paid pilot starts.
- Promise only a conservative SLA: paid pilot first response within 1 business day; free/demo best effort.
- Use GitHub Issues for public bugs only; keep customer data out of public issues.

## Launch blockers that must stay explicit

- Redacted audit has 2 possible secret-pattern finding(s); manually review before publication or deploy.
- Payment/KYC/tax setup requires account-owner action; no payment link is live from this automation.
- Privacy policy/terms/refund language requires owner/legal review before customer data or money collection.
- Production launch, custom domain/DNS, analytics, and support inbox changes require explicit approval.

## Pre-launch checklist

- [ ] Repo-specific verification passes locally and/or in CI.
- [ ] Secret-pattern audit findings are reviewed and resolved or documented as false positives.
- [ ] Public copy avoids revenue guarantees and unsupported legal/medical/financial/security claims.
- [ ] Privacy policy, terms/refund policy, and support scope are approved by the owner before publication.
- [ ] Payment account/KYC/tax configuration is complete before accepting money.
- [ ] Support inbox, escalation owner, response window, and customer-data handling are ready.
- [ ] Production deployment, custom domain/DNS, analytics, and email capture are explicitly approved.

## Support macros

- **Bug intake:** ask for environment, reproduction steps, expected/actual result, logs with secrets removed, and impact level.
- **Paid pilot intake:** capture buyer, use case, data sensitivity, success metric, deadline, access constraints, and decision owner.
- **Refund/escalation:** acknowledge within the promised support window, preserve the order/customer reference privately, and escalate policy exceptions to the owner.
- **Data request:** verify requester identity through the approved support channel, avoid public issue threads, and log deletion/export actions.
