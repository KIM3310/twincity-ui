# System Architecture - twincity-ui

This document is the system-level architecture attachment for the repository. It keeps the technical stack, runtime boundary, data/control flow, deployment surface, and operating assumptions in one place.

## Architecture Summary

| Area | Design |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | `twincity-ui` |
| Primary domain | operations control surfaces and reliability automation |
| Primary stack | Node/TypeScript runtime, Terraform infrastructure modules, Container build surface, GitHub Actions validation |
| Architecture axes | cloud architecture, AI engineering, reliability, security, operator experience |

Repository-local proof surface for operations control surfaces and reliability automation, backed by Node/TypeScript runtime, Terraform infrastructure modules, Container build surface.

## Runtime And Data Flow

    User["User or technical inspection"] --> Surface["Public demo, CLI, package, or README surface"]
    Surface --> Runtime["Runtime boundary: Node/TypeScript runtime, Terraform infrastructure modules, Container build surface, GitHub Actions validation"]
    Runtime --> Control["Control plane: configuration, policies, adapters, and jobs"]
    Control --> Data["Data and artifacts: fixtures, reports, logs, exports, or model outputs"]
    Runtime --> Observability["Observability and validation hooks"]
    Observability --> Handoff["Documented handoff and operating boundary"]
    Data --> Handoff
```

Primary domain: operations control surfaces and reliability automation.

## Stack Surface

| Layer | Current surface | Operating note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interface | Public demo, README, CLI, package, or static proof surface depending on repository shape | Keep the first screen or command path inspectable without private credentials. |
| Runtime | Node/TypeScript runtime, Terraform infrastructure modules, Container build surface, GitHub Actions validation | Keep runtime adapters bounded by environment configuration and documented fallbacks. |
| Control plane | Policies, configuration, job orchestration, tests, and release scripts | Keep operator-impacting changes traceable through docs and validation hooks. |
| Data and artifacts | Fixtures, generated reports, screenshots, exports, logs, or model outputs | Keep sample and generated artifacts clearly separated from private or customer data. |
| Operations | CI, local validation, architecture guard, and handoff notes | Keep the architecture docs current when runtime, data, or deployment boundaries change. |

## Cloud Or Local Deployment Boundary

Operating model: event-driven control planes, observability-first services, SLO dashboards, and resilient data stores

### Deployment patterns

- Infrastructure-as-code entrypoint with explicit variables, outputs, and provider boundaries
- Containerized runtime path suitable for repeatable local, staging, or managed service deployment
- Event-driven control surface with telemetry, escalation, and operator handoff states

### Control boundaries

- identity boundary and least-privilege service access
- environment separation for local, staging, and managed runtime paths
- secret storage outside source and deterministic fallback for missing credentials
- observability hooks for logs, metrics, traces, and audit events
- rollback path for deployment, schema, and model changes

### Resilience controls

- bounded retries with explicit failure states
- health/readiness checks before operator-facing flows are trusted
- idempotent data or artifact writes where repeat execution is possible
- cost and quota guardrails for hosted services and model adapters

## AI And Automation Boundary

Operating model: incident summarization, action recommendation, anomaly explanation, operator handoff, and replayable decision support

### Engineering patterns

- Turn telemetry into summaries, incident narratives, action queues, and shift handoff artifacts
- Preserve the source event trail beside generated explanations for fast correction and audit
- Separate deterministic checks from model-generated output so the system remains testable without external credentials
- Capture prompts, inputs, outputs, and decision metadata as inspectable artifacts instead of hidden side effects
- Gate model-assisted actions with policy, confidence, and fallback states before they reach an operator path

### Evaluation and model-risk controls

- deterministic fixtures for CI-safe verification
- golden output or schema checks for generated artifacts
- trace capture for prompts, tool calls, inputs, and outputs
- quality gates that fail closed when evidence is missing

### Risks to keep explicit

- stale telemetry
- opaque recommendations
- handoff loss
- weak rollback or escalation paths
